# ceph-performce-killer
---
this project aims to find a way to detect the performce bottleneck of ceph cluster.

currently, there is no one tool can be used to figure out the performace bottleneck of one ceph cluster.

we want to do some things like:
1. we can easily find out some slow OSDes in a huge ceph cluster.
2. we can easily satistic the frequences of a stage during a specific short time.
3. we can not add too much overload for the ceph cluster.
